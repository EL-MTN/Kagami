# Ingest

Ingest is the write path: turn conversation transcripts (or single caller-supplied facts) into rows in the `facts` and `entities` collections. All code lives under `apps/api/src/ingest/`, with `apps/api/src/storage/` as the persistence layer.

## Layout

```
apps/api/src/ingest/

Two entry points are exposed to clients:

| Entry                                  | Reaches                                     | When to use                                                                                                                              |

## Transcript format (`transcript.ts`)

`parseTranscript(raw: string)` parses:

```
---
id: <session-id>
started_at: 2025-08-12T14:00:00Z
---

## t-0 user
Hi, I just got back from Berlin.

## t-1 assistant
How was the trip? Did you visit anyone?
```

- Frontmatter is YAML, validated by `TranscriptFrontmatter` (`{ id, started_at }`). `started_at` accepts a string or `Date` and normalizes to ISO.
- Turn headings match `^##\s+(t-\d+)\s+(\S+)\s*$`; the second capture is the role (`user`, `assistant`, or anything else — `consolidate` only treats the lowercase `user` specially).
- Body lines after a heading accumulate into `text` and are trimmed.

## Consolidation pipeline (`consolidate.ts`)

The core ingest. Constants:

| Constant                   | Value | Purpose                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BATCH_SIZE`               | 2     | Messages per extraction call (one user + one assistant turn).          |
| `TOP_K_EXISTING`           | 10    | Cosine-nearest existing facts shown to the extractor as dedup context. |
| `RECENTLY_EXTRACTED_LIMIT` | 20    | Tail of in-run extracted facts also shown for cross-batch coherence.   |
| `LAST_K_MESSAGES`          | 20    | Conversation context preceding the batch, fed into the prompt.         |

Per `consolidate(transcript, opts)`:

1. **Read scope-bound dedup context.** `readFactsInScope({ user_id, run_id, agent_id })`. Cosine-near-neighbors outside this tuple do not constrain extraction.
2. **Compute or read the rolling session summary.** `getOrComputeSessionSummary(...)` returns a 4–8 sentence narrative grounding entities and references for every batch. Cached in `session_summaries` keyed by `source_session` so a re-run on the same transcript reuses it.
3. **For each 2-message batch:**
   - Embed the concatenated batch text (`embed`, 15 s timeout).
   - Pick top-10 cosine-nearest from `existingFacts ∪ recentlyExtracted` as `existingMemories`.
   - Build the user prompt sections: Summary, Last k Messages, Recently Extracted, Existing Memories, New Messages, Observation Date, Current Date.
   - `generateObject(model, ExtractionResult)` against `prompts/extraction.md` — schema is `{ memory: [{ id, text, category }] }`. `temperature: 0`, 120 s timeout. The reasoning-to-content middleware in `llm.ts` salvages output for thinking-mode models that emit into `reasoning_content`.
   - **LLM relevance filter** (`filterDurableFacts`, `relevance.ts`): one batched temp-0 binary classifier judges the extracted candidates and drops purely conversational noise (greetings, affection, acknowledgements, assistant self-narration). Default-KEEP and **fail-open** — any classifier error keeps all candidates. A batch left empty here is skipped.
   - `embedMany(extracted texts)` (30 s timeout) → one embedding per surviving memory.
   - **Cosine dedup** (`NEAR_DUPE_COSINE = 0.97`): for each extracted memory's embedding, skip if cosine ≥ threshold against any (a) existing in-scope fact, (b) earlier-batch extraction in this run (`recentlyExtracted`), or (c) earlier-accepted fact in _this_ batch. Survivors get `normalizeCategory(raw)` applied (unknown → `"misc"`).
   - Build `Fact` rows with `id = randomUUID()`, `created_at = now`, `event_date = sessionDate`, `source_session = "raw/<sessionId>"`.
   - `appendFacts(rows)` → `insertMany({ ordered: false })`. No storage-layer dedup index — dedup already happened above.
   - `upsertEntitiesFromFacts(rows)` to keep the entity-boost ranker fed.
   - Append rows to `recentlyExtracted` so the next batch's cosine top-10 and dedup pass include them.

Returns `{ added, batches, failed }`. `batches` counts content-bearing batches attempted; `failed` counts those that errored out (embed/extraction/fact-embed). A batch that legitimately produces nothing (empty extraction, all relevance-filtered, all dupes) is neither — so `failed` lets the caller tell "nothing to remember" apart from "the pipeline broke."

The threshold matches `append.ts`'s 0.97. The original 0.92 (chosen on the assumption that batch-extraction LLMs produce sloppier near-duplicates than caller-curated single facts) over-merged on LongMemEval — multi-session recall dropped 7.5pp and temporal-reasoning 5pp — because legitimately distinct facts about the same entity often land at 0.92–0.96 even when their content is materially different.

### Categories

The extraction prompt asks the model to emit one of:

```
personal_details · family · professional_details · sports · travel · food
music · health · technology · hobbies · fashion · entertainment · milestones
user_preferences · misc
```

`normalizeCategory(raw)` lowercases + trims and falls back to `"misc"` for unknown values. `category` is required on the wire (OpenAI's strict json_schema mode rejects optional properties), but writers always have a usable value.

### Failure modes

- Embed call fails: log + `continue` (skip this batch) + `failed += 1`. The next batch is independent.
- Extraction call fails: log + `continue` + `failed += 1`.
- **Every** content-bearing batch fails (`failed === batches`, `added === 0`): the transcript was already persisted (step 0) but no facts could be extracted — `sessions.ts` throws `IngestExtractionError` so the HTTP route returns 500 and the MCP tool reports failure, instead of a silent zero-fact "success" that leaves an orphaned transcript with no signal to the caller. Re-ingest is idempotent (transcript upserts, summary is cached, surviving facts cosine-dedup), so the failure is safely retryable. A _partial_ failure (some batches succeed) keeps the facts it got and is observable via the returned `failed` count.
- Entity upsert fails: log + proceed. Facts are durable; entity boost is best-effort.
- Mongo `insertMany` errors propagate. There is no longer a storage-layer hash dedup index, so any `code 11000` would be an `_id` collision (a programming bug) rather than expected dedup behavior — surfacing it is intentional.

## Single-fact append (`append.ts`)

`appendSingleFact(input)` and `appendFactsBulk(inputs)` (max 500). Bypasses the LLM extraction pipeline; the caller has already decided this is a fact worth keeping. Both serialize on a process-wide async lock (`withAppendLock`) so the cosine near-dupe check can't race with itself across concurrent calls.

```
NEAR_DUPE_COSINE = 0.97
```

Pipeline (`appendSingleFactImpl`):

1. Trim text; reject empty.
2. Read scope-bound facts.
3. `embedQuestion(text)` (5 s timeout via `embed`).
4. Compute cosine against every in-scope existing fact. If `bestSim ≥ 0.97` → return `{ status: "duplicate", similarity }` with the near-dupe's id.
5. Build `Fact` with `event_date` defaulting to today, `source_session` defaulting to `""`.
6. `appendFacts([fact])` (audits ADD via `recordEvents`).
7. `upsertEntitiesFromFacts([fact])` (logged + tolerated on failure).
8. Return `{ id, status: "added" }`.

Bulk path runs the same impl in series under the lock and returns one result per input in order.

### Why the lock?

The cosine check is a read-then-act sequence — two concurrent calls with cosine-similar text would each see no near-dupe and both insert without serialization. `$vectorSearch` can't atomically guard insertion. The lock is narrow (single + bulk paths only); transcript ingest is unaffected (its dedup pass is single-threaded within one `consolidate()` invocation, and concurrent invocations on the same session are uncommon enough to be acceptable).

## Session ingest (`sessions.ts`)

The HTTP-shaped wrapper. Hit by `POST /sessions` and the MCP `ingest_session` tool.

```
ingestSessionFromString({ transcript, user_id, run_id, agent_id, metadata })
  ├─ parseTranscript(transcript)
  ├─ upsertTranscript(parsed, scope)              ← transcripts collection (source-of-truth)
  ├─ consolidate(parsed, scope, metadata)         ← atomic facts
  ├─ if (batches > 0 && failed === batches) throw IngestExtractionError   ← all batches failed
  └─ return { sessionId, added, batches, failed }
```

The narrative session summary (4–8 sentences) generated by `generateNarrativeSummary` in `session-summary.ts` is a separate artifact: it lives in the `session_summaries` collection keyed by `source_session` and is fed into every batch's extraction prompt to ground entities and references. It is **not** stored as a fact. The previous "summary fact" (a keyword-rich clause persisted as `On <date>, conversation covered: <topics>.`) was removed — those clauses behaved as low-IDF retrieval noise that matched almost any query.

## Persistence

Writes flow through `apps/api/src/storage/`:

- `appendFacts(facts, actor?)` — `insertMany({ ordered: false })` against `facts`. No `code 11000` tolerance: dedup is enforced upstream (cosine in `append.ts` / `consolidate.ts`), so a duplicate-key error here would be an `_id` collision worth surfacing rather than swallowing. Records an ADD event in `history` for every input fact via `recordEvents`.
- `upsertTranscript(input)` — `updateOne(_id, $set, $setOnInsert: { created_at })` against `transcripts`. Re-ingest just refreshes `updated_at`.
- `upsertEntitiesFromFacts(facts)` — extracts proper-noun + quoted entities, `$setOnInsert` on new entities (with embedding), `$addToSet` on `linked_memory_ids`. Race-safe under concurrent ingest.
- `getOrComputeSessionSummary(...)` — read-then-upsert with `$setOnInsert`; first writer wins.

See [storage.md](storage.md) for the schema and indexes.

## Curation pass (`curate.ts`)

The on-demand counterpart to extraction. Extraction is append-only and conservative; over time the store accretes conversational residue (play-by-play narration, transient states), paraphrased near-duplicates below the 0.97 cosine gate, roll-up/atomic double extractions, and same-day contradiction clusters. `planCuration()` re-reads the corpus with an LLM editor and `applyCuration()` executes its verdicts.

```
planCuration(scope)
  readFactsInScope → clusterFacts (cosine ≥ 0.8 union-find; multi-member
  clusters reviewed as units, singletons coalesced into batches of 20)
  → one generateObject call per group against prompts/curate.md
  → per-fact verdicts: keep | drop | merge

applyCuration(plan)
  drop       → deleteFacts + history DELETE + entity unlink
  merge n=1  → rewriteFact in place (id stable) + history UPDATE + entity relink
  merge n≥2  → one replacement fact (metadata.curated_from = member ids,
               event_date = LLM-provided or earliest member) + history ADD
               + member DELETEs + entity relink
```

Clustering is mechanical context assembly — every judgment is the LLM's (`prompts/curate.md` carries the drop/merge rulebook). Verdicts that fail validation (missing/duplicated ids, empty merge text) or error fail **open**: the group is kept untouched, the same default-keep posture as `relevance.ts`. Merged-text embeddings are batched up front so an embedding outage leaves the store untouched.

Operator CLI:

```bash
npx tsx apps/api/scripts/curate.ts          # dry run — prints the plan
npx tsx apps/api/scripts/curate.ts --apply  # execute (history-journaled, actor "curate")
npx tsx apps/api/scripts/curate.ts --user u1 --run r1 --agent a1 --json
```

This is the sanctioned exception to "atomic facts are write-once": the ingest path never updates or deletes, the curator may do both, and every mutation leaves an UPDATE/DELETE row in `history`.
